# paleoSDMs_Neotoma_small_mammals

This repo is for retrieving all small mammal occurrences for input to the SDMs.  In this script, I do the following:

1) retrieve all vertebrate datasets from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database
2) scroll through each dataset and associate samples with the new Syverson-Blois chronologies
3) filter samples to only include mammals in the orders Rodentia and Soricomorpha
4) associate Neotoma taxon names with an in-development version of a mammal taxonomy matching document
