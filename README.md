# paleoSDMs_Neotoma_small_mammals
This repo is for retrieving all vertebrate datasets from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database, associating samples with the new Syverson-Blois chronologies, filtering samples to only include mammals in the orders Rodentia and Soricomorpha, then associating Neotoma taxon names with an in-development version of a mammal taxonomy matching document.
